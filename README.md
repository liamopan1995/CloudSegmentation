# Contour-based SLAM for a Robust Odometry for Forestry Vehicles

A modified version of Patchworkpp with additional code for Stem Segmentation

## Introduction

Recognizing tree contours within densely managed forests through LiDAR(Light Detection
and Ranging) and futher identifying stem locations are feasible. Hence employing resulting
stem-location maps as references for localization is achievable.

This study introduces a novel Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm
that relies on identifying stem points based on the spatial distribution properties of laser
points. The stem model is constructed as a series of cylinders, and stem location is
estimated using this model, at the post end, G2O is applied for post-end optimization.

The performance of this algorithm is assessed by comparing its results with those obtained
through the GNSS and one state-of-the-art SLAM algorithm for the same trajectory.
The ndings demonstrate that utilizing stem-location features for simultaneous localization
and mapping presents a robust solution for SLAM in densely managed forests.

The ground segmentation is done with Patchworkpp library which can be found at [Patchwork++ ROS](https://github.com/original_repository_link). Please refer to the original repository for more information about Patchworkpp.

## Features

- Ground segmentation: Utilize Patchworkpp's ground segmentation functionality to identify and extract ground points from a point cloud.
- Stem segmentation: Build upon Patchworkpp to include code that can extract tree stems or trunks from the point cloud data.
